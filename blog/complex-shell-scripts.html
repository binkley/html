        <h3>Complex shell scripts</h3>

        <p>Most projects reach the point where dependencies on other programs,
            command line startup for the project itself, data management,
            etc., become taxing to manage manually on the command line.
            The classic example is combining a database with an application
            program, and these days, with Docker in the mix. Concerns
            include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Building the appliction program(s) from local source</li>
            <li>Providing for the database(s)</li>
            <li>Installing any database schema(s) and seed data</li>
            <li>Setting up any mock services that are not run locally</li>
            <li>Fixing up the runtime environment, such as special command
                line flags, environment variables, or special local files
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Managing all of these may wind up with 5 or 10 command line steps
            to carry out in sequence before the full application system is
            usable locally.</p>

        <p>What to do? The obvious thing: <em>automate</em>, and automating
            means scripting.</p>

        <p>In principle, these steps could be executed using the same source
            language as the application; in practice, that is rarely done as
            few languages excel at process management, and most are painful to
            use for this purpose. For example, a simple thing as exit status
            can be overly tricky to manage from most source languages. We'd
            like a failed exit code from our command line when the steps we
            execute fail.</p>

    <section id="bash">
        <h3>Bash</h3>

        <p>There are other choices for scripting, but let us say we choose to
            use Bash. This is the most common choice:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Bash is a very stable language, widely known</li>
            <li>It is portable across all important operating environments
            </li>
            <li>Documentation and online help are widely available</li>
            <li>Script feedback is quick: the edit/test/fix cycle is short
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The reset of this post is a collection of Bash idioms for local
            development scripts. I've carried them around from project to
            project. Mostly they move by word of mouth, or appear haphazardly
            in online forums.</p>

        <h3>Generic starter script</h3>

        <p>The best thing when starting fresh is to begin from a working
            example, especially when there is a store of folk wisdom at hand.
            I'm happy to profit from the experience of others!</p>

        <p>To this end, I keep a <a
                href="https://github.com/binkley/shell/tree/master/starter">generic
            starter script</a> in GitHub which opens:</p>

        <pre class="code">#!/usr/bin/env bash

export PS4='+${BASH_SOURCE}:${LINENO}:${FUNCNAME[0]:+${FUNCNAME[0]}():} '

set -e
set -u
set -o pipefail</pre>

        <p>Like some magic incantation, each of these lines is crucial to a
            decent developer shell script. To wit:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code> ensures you are using the
                <em>same</em> version of Bash when you try out code yourself
                in your shell, as what the script executes. Relying on the
                system shell, <code>/bin/bash</code> or <code>/bin/sh</code>
                for scripts leaves you subject to the whims of operating
                system upgrades, or in the case of some (looking at you
                MacOS), a tremendously out of date version of Bash.
            </li>
            <li>The export of <code>PS4</code> is mysterious. There are
                several variants of this: essentially it means when you turn
                on execution tracing (debugging) with the <code>-x</code>
                flag, Bash informs you of (1) line number, and (2) function
                name, as it runs your script, even across sourcing (the <code>.</code>
                "dot" operator) other scripts into yours.
            </li>
            <li>Lastly, the three <code>set</code> commands help you keep your
                script clean:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>set -e</code> fails your script at the first
                        sign of trouble, rather than bravely continuing
                    </li>
                    <li><code>set -u</code> fails your script when it tries to
                        use an uninitialized variable
                    </li>
                    <li><code>set -o pipefail</code> has failing pipelines
                        (the <code>|</code> "vertical bar" operator) exit with
                        the code of the failing portion of the pipe;
                        otherwise, it might bravely continue on even with
                        failing commands
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Parsing option flags</h3>

        <p>Everyone like nice command line flags, the most popular being
            <code>-h</code> or "help". Further, after a while, most prefer
            typing <code>-n</code> rather than <code>--really-long-option-containing-an-n</code>!
            To set this up in your script, use this idiom:
        </p>

        <pre class="code">while getopts :h-: opt; do
  [[ $opt == - ]] && opt=${OPTARG%%=*} OPTARG=${OPTARG#*=}
  case $opt in
    h | help ) print-help ; exit 0 ;;
    * ) print-usage >&2 ; exit 2 ;;
  esac
done
shift $((OPTIND - 1))</pre>

        <p>Wow, that got deep quickly!</p>
