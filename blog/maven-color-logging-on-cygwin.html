<p><strong>WORKAROUND:</strong> Thanks to comment by <a
        href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/111012722058314768782">Zart
    Colwing</a>, there is a workaround. Add
    <code>-Djansi.passthrough=true</code> to <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code>. It is
    not enough to add the flag to the command line; it needs to be seen by
    JANSI before maven begins parsing the command line.</p>

<p>I'm quite happy Maven 3.5.0 has added color logging!</p>

<p>With earlier versions of maven, I used Jean-Christophe Guy's <a
        href="https://github.com/jcgay/maven-color">excellent maven-color
    extension</a>. On Windows that involved some manual hacking of my maven
    installation, but on Mac, it was trivial with homebrew.</p>

<p>So now I'm getting color output from maven out of the box. Except when I
    don't.</p>

<p>You see, this new feature relies on <a
        href="https://github.com/fusesource/jansi">the good JAnsi library</a>.
    And JAnsi presently has an issue with color on Cygwin. When I'm at home,
    Cygwin is my mainstay, used on my gaming-cum-programming rig, so this is
    significant to me. What is the issue? No color&mdash;JAnsi detects I'm on
    Windows, and uses the native Windows console color handling, which doesn't
    work in Mintty or Xterm. Those use standard ANSI escape sequences, etc.
    rather than an OS-specific library.</p>

<p>Digging through the source for JAnsi, I find <a
        href="https://github.com/fusesource/jansi/blob/c6830ac1e54b1f8fd3985c5fe595a835ad56046a/jansi/src/main/java/org/fusesource/jansi/AnsiConsole.java#L46">the
    trouble spot</a>:</p>

<pre class="code">private static final boolean IS_WINDOWS = System.getProperty("os.name").toLowerCase(Locale.ENGLISH).contains("win");</pre>

<p>Aha! The special Windows-handling code kicks in when the
    <code>os.name</code> system property contains "win" (in any case). Using
    the <code>jps</code> and <code>jinfo</code> tools that come with the JDK,
    I double-checked against a long-running maven build (16848 just was the
    PID used by the JVM for this maven build; use <code>jps</code> to list all
    current PIDs):</p>

<pre class="code">$ jinfo -sysprops 16848 | grep os.name
os.name = Windows 10</pre>

<p>Some experimenting found a way to work around that:</p>

<pre class="code">MAVEN_OPTS=-Dos.name=Cygwin mvn clean</pre>

<p>(You need to use <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code> rather than passing <code>-Dos.name=Cygwin</code>
    to maven; once maven starts the value is immutable.)</p>

<p>Color is back. It turns out, any value for <code>os.name</code> will work
    (for example, "Bob") as long as it doesn't contain "win". I picked
    "Cygwin" for explicitness.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I have to rethink this. Sure I get color now, but
    at the expense of <code>maven test</code> failing as maven no longer
    believes I'm on Windows, so is unhappy at the lack of a
    <code>/bin/sh</code> and general UNIX filesystem. One step forward, two
    steps back.</p>
