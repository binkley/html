<p>I cannot tell you how to write <em>good</em> Java, but I can help you write
    <strong>clean</strong> Java. As usual, automation is key. It's all about
    the tooling.</p>

<p>The best thing about good tooling is that they work together: each covers a
    different area, does not impeded another tool, and fixing one complaint a
    tool reveals often fixes complaints from other tools.</p>

<p>This advice applies to any programming language, not just Java. Java,
    having the most mature ecosystem, is instructive.</p>

<h3 id="the-tools">The tools</h3>

<dl>
    <dt><em>Use good source control</em></dt>
    <dd><a href="https://git-scm.com/" title="Git">Git</a> is your best
        choice. Use either <a href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/"
                              title="Trunk Based Development">trunk-based
            development</a> with <a
                href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/feature-flags/"
                title="Feature flags - Trunk Based Development">feature
            toggles (feature flags)</a>, or <a
                href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow">gitflow</a>
        patterns, depending on your needs and organization. Require full
        builds and testing before pushing to a shared repository; <a
                href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks"
                title="Git - Git Hooks">hooks</a> can help together with your
        build tool.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Use good build automation</em></dt>
    <dd><a href="https://maven.apache.org/" title="Welcome to Apache Maven">Maven</a>
        or <a href="https://gradle.org/" title="Gradle Build Tool">Gradle</a>
        are your best choices; either is excellent. Teach the tool to be
        strict and fail builds if anything is not just right. Treat your build
        configuration as code, part of the same repository and held to the
        same hygiene standards. Keep your local build fast.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Use a good editor</em></dt>
    <dd><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"
           title="IntelliJ IDEA: The Java IDE for Professional Developers by JetBrains">IntelliJ</a>
        is the best choice. Use <a
                href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-inspection.html"
                title="Code Inspection">inspections</a>, <a
                href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/intention-actions.html"
                title="Intention Actions">intentions</a>, and <a
                href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/reformatting-source-code.html"
                title="Reformatting Source Code">reformatting</a> obsessively:
        code diffs should only show real changes, not whitespace or
        formatting. Use <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/"
                           title="JetBrains Plugin Repository">plugins</a> to
        ease integrating IntelliJ with other tooling.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Keep your style consistent</em></dt>
    <dd><a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/" title="Checkstyle">Checkstyle</a>
        is your best choice; other choices are needed for non-Java JVM
        languages. Fail your build if checkstyle complains. Keep your IntelliJ
        formatting and Checkstyle rules consistent. Generally, choose either
        <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/sun_style.html"
           title="checkstyle &#x2013; Sun's Java Style">Sun</a> or <a
                href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/google_style.html"
                title="checkstyle &#x2013; Google's Style">Google</a> coding
        standards, and be leary of deviating from them; if unsure, pick Sun.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Fully test your code</em></dt>
    <dd><a href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/"
           title="EclEmma - JaCoCo Java Code Coverage Library">JaCoCo</a>
        works well. Fail your build if coverage drops below a threshhold;
        rachet up the threshhold as coverage improves. Start low and aim for a
        95%+ threshhold. Follow <a
                href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html"
                title="Google Testing Blog: Just Say No to More End-to-End Tests">the
            <em>Test Pyramid</em></a>; save your end-to-end tests for CI, or
        run locally only once before pushing commits.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Be zealous in looking for problems</em></dt>
    <dd><a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/"
           title="FindBugs&trade; - Find Bugs in Java Programs">FindBugs</a>,
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/" title="PMD">PMD</a>,
        or <a href="http://errorprone.info/" title="Error Prone">Error
            Prone</a> are your best choices (pick one); other choices may work
        better for non-Java JVM languages. Fail your build if your choice
        complains. Be judicious in disabling complaints (for example, FindBugs
        "experimental" checks, should likely be disabled).
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Use code generation</em></dt>
    <dd><a href="https://projectlombok.org/" title="Project Lombok">Lombok</a>
        is your first choice. <a
                href="https://medium.com/@iammert/annotation-processing-dont-repeat-yourself-generate-your-code-8425e60c6657"
                title="Annotation Processing : Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself, Generate Your Code.">Add
            others as needed</a> (or build domain-specific code generators).
        Generated code does not need test coverage, style checks, or bug
        detection if the generator is clean and well-tested: trust it.
