<p>I'm using <code>make</code> for a simple shell project, to run tests before
    committing. The check was trivial:</p>

<pre class="code">SHELL = bash

test:
&#9;@./run-tests t | grep 'Summary: 16 PASSED, 0 FAILED, 0 ERRORED' &gt;/dev/null</pre>

<p>This has the nice quality of <em>Silence is Golden</em>: say nothing when
    all is good. However, it loses the quality of <em>Complain on Failure</em>:
    it simply fails without saying why.</p>

<p>A better solution, preserving both qualities:</p>

<pre class="code">SHELL = bash

test:
&#9;@diff --color=auto \
&#9;    &lt;(./run-tests t | grep 'Summary: .* PASSED, .* FAILED, .* ERRORED') \
&#9;    &lt;(echo 'Summary: 16 PASSED, 0 FAILED, 0 ERRORED')</pre>

<p>It still says nothing when all is good, but now shows on failure how many
    tests went awry. <em>Bonus</em>: color for programmers who like that sort
    of thing.</p>

<p>Why set <code>SHELL</code> to <code>bash</code>? I'm taking advantage of <a
        href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html#Process-Substitution"><cite>Process
    Substitution</cite></a>. Essentially the command outputs inside the
    subshells are turned into special kinds of files, and <code>diff</code>
    likes to compare files. Ksh and Zsh also support process substitution, so
    I'm going with the most widely available option.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p> <p>Why are my arguments to <code>diff</code>
    ordered like that? In usual testing language, I'm comparing "actual" vs
    "expected", and more commonly you'll see programmers list "expected"
    first.</p>

<p><code>diff</code> by default colors the <em>left-hand</em> input in <span
        style="color:red">RED</span>, and the <em>right-hand</em> input in
    <span style="color:green">GREEN</span>. On failure, it makes more sense to
    color "actual" in red and "expected" in green. Example output on failure:
</p>

<pre class="code">$ make
<span style="color:cyan">1c1</span>
<span style="color:red">&lt; Summary: 17 PASSED, 1 FAILED, 0 ERRORED</span>
---
<span style="color:green">&gt; Summary: 19 PASSED, 0 FAILED, 0 ERRORED</span>
make: *** [Makefile:4: test] Error 1</pre>
