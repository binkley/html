<p>There may be a better way, but I found that running <code>kotlinc</code> to
    bring up the Kotlin REPL, while in a Cygwin BASH shell using Mintty, did
    not respond to keyboard input. A little research indicated the issue is
    with JLine, which has some understandable difficulties reconciling running
    under Cygwin with running under CMD.</p> <p>The workaround I used:</p>
<pre class="code">$ JAVA_OPTS='-Djline.terminal=unix' kotlinc
Welcome to Kotlin version 1.1.1 (JRE 1.8.0_121-b13)
Type :help for help, :quit for quit
>>> println("FOOBAR")
println("FOOBAR")
FOOBAR</pre> <p>Requesting JLine to use UNIX-y primitives for terminal access
    solved the problem. I would like to hear about other solutions.</p> <p>
