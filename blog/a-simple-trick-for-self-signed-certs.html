<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<p>I work with clients in corporate environments who choose to use
    <em>self-signed SSL certificates</em>. And I sometimes work remotely
    over VPN using non-client computers.</p>

<p>The difficulty over VPN is that client does not register these certs with
    any root authority, so when using a build tool like Gradle, the JVM cannot
    download internal dependencies hosted within the client's network.
    The JVM will complain loudly that HTTPS to a dependency service (for
    example, Nexus) has an unusable SSL certificate (PKIX path errors,
    etc).</p>

<h3 id="a-solution">A solution</h3>

<p>One solution is to add client self-signed certificates into the
    <code>cacerts</code> file of the local JDK installation. However,
    working with mutliple clients, I am not comfortable with this. For
    example, there is no revocation policy for these certificates (though
    they can eventually expire).</p>

<p>With Gradle, however, there is a better alternative. I had <a

        title="Customizing the Default Keystores and Truststores, Store Types, and Store Passwords">difficulty</a>

            title="Configuring JVM memory">together</a>; hopefully this post
    will remind my future self.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Generate a project-specific <code>cacerts</code> file by adding
        all needed client self-signed SSL certificates into the standard
        JDK <code>cacerts</code> file, <code>lib/security/cacerts</code>,
        found in <code>$JAVA_HOME</code>. <em>Do this at client with their
            JDK installation</em>, not your off-site local JDK.
    </li>
    <li>Add the client-specific <code>cacerts</code> file to the project
        source. (Here I put the file in the project root, but it could be
        in a path underneath the project: relative paths work.)
    </li>
    <li>Teach Gradle to use the project-specific <code>cacerts</code> file
        by adding a JVM flag in <code>gradle.properties</code>:
        <strong><code>-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=&lt;path/to/project/cacerts&gt;</code></strong>.
        If you do not already have JVM flags for the project Gradle, these
        file contents suffice:
        <pre>
# Gradle properties
# This uses the local `cacerts`, which include client certs, without modifying the JDK
# The memory flags are from
# https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:configuring_jvm_memory
# and are the defaults
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=cacerts -Xmx512m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m</pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>This works also for Maven or Ant, modulo details specific to them.</p>
