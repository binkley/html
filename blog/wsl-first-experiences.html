<p>I first tried Windows Subsystem for Linux in December 2016, but was not
    successful in installing, so I held off.</p>

<p>After getting the Windows 10 Creators Edition update, I saw <a
        href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2017/04/11/windows-10-creators-update-whats-new-in-bashwsl-windows-console/"
        title="Windows 10 Creators Update: What’s new in Bash/WSL & Windows Console">how
    much work and love</a> went into improving WSL, and decided to try again.
    I was rewarded.</p>

<p>On the whole, the installation was smooth, brief, you might even say <a
        href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/T/trivial.html">trivial</a>. There
    were Windows reboots to enable Developer Mode, and after installing WSL,
    but much solid effort has gone into making Windows reboots quick and
    painless, and with a regular Linux distro I'd have rebooted anyhow after
    upgrading, so no disgruntlement.</p>

<p>And what did I get for my efforts? WSL bash is bash. Just bash. Really, it
    is just plain old bash, with all the command line tools I've grown
    accustomed to over 30 years. The best praise I can give a tool: <em>It
        just works</em>. And WSL just works. (But see <a href="#almost-there"><cite>Almost
        there</cite></a>, below.)</p>

<p>Out of the box WSL runs Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), the official LTS
    distribution (long-term support). This is a sane choice for Microsoft.
    It's stable, reliable, secure, tested, trusted. For anyone wanting a
    working Linux command line, this is a go-to choice. Still, I updated
    it.</p>

<h3 id="things-i-changed">Things I changed</h3>

<p>Even with all the goodness, there were some things I had to change:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>The terminal</dt>
    <dd>I immediately installed <a href="https://github.com/mintty/wsltty"
                                   title="Mintty as a terminal for Bash on Ubuntu on Windows / WSL">Mintty
        for WSL</a>. I've grown to love Mintty on Cygwin, trusting it as a
        reliable and featureful terminal emulator without going overboard.
        It's a tasteful balance, well executed. And <code>CMD.EXE</code>,
        though much improved, still is not there (but may head there; we'll
        see if PowerShell wins out).
    </dd>

    <dt>DBus</dt>
    <dd>Not to get into flamewars, I just accept that Ubuntu uses DBus. By
        default it doesn't run on WSL, but this was easy to fix, and it made
        upgrading Ubuntu smoother. Using <code>sudo</code>, edit <code>/etc/dbus-1/session.conf</code>
        as
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4rsmzp/bash_on_windows_getting_dbus_and_x_server_working/">others
            have suggested</a> (I did it by hand, not with <code>sed</code>).
        You may have to repeat after upgrading Ubuntu.
    </dd>

    <dt>The Ubuntu version</dt>
    <dd>It seems trivial, but I was unhappy that <code>diff --color</code>
        didn't work. Am I shallow&mdash;color? Some of the scripts <a
                href="https://github.com/binkley/shell"
                title="Helpful shell scripts and programs">I write</a> for
        open source provide colorized diff output, and I'd like to work on
        them in WSL without disabling this feature. Microsoft made <a
                href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2016/09/22/24-bit-color-in-the-windows-console/"
                title="24-bit Color in the Windows Console!">much hay</a> over
        24-bit color support in <code>CMD.EXE</code>. So <a
                href="#upgrading-wsl-ubuntu" title="Upgrading WSL Ubuntu">I
            updated to Ubuntu 17</a>, which includes diffutils 3.5 (the
        version in which <code>--color</code> was added). Microsoft does not
        official support upgrading Ubuntu, but I ran into no real problems.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="upgrading-wsl-ubuntu">Upgrading WSL Ubuntu</h3>

<p><em>Caveat coder</em> &mdash; there is a <em>reason</em> this is
    unsupported by Microsoft at present. I just never ran into those reasons
    myself. For example, I used DBus to make upgrading happier; I am not using
    any Linux desktop (graphical) programs, so maybe this could be a reason.

       title="How to Update a Ubuntu LTS release to the next LTS Version (release upgrade)">helpful</a>
    Internet sources, I:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Edited <tt>/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades</tt> to use "normal"
        releases, not just LTS
    </li>
    <li>Fixed <code>/etc/dbus-1/session.conf</code></li>
    <li>Ran <code>sudo do-release-upgrade</code> to move to 16.10 from 16.04
    </li>
    <li>Re-fixed <code>/etc/dbus-1/session.conf</code></li>
    <li>Ran <code>sudo do-release-upgrade -d</code> to move to 17.04 from
        16.10
    </li>
</ol>

<p>(Pay attention: there are many "yN" prompts were the default is to abort:
    you <strong>must</strong> enter "y" to these!)</p>

<p>When I am prompted to reboot, I quit the upgrade, close all WSL terminals,
    and start a fresh one. There is <a
            href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/04/22/windows-subsystem-for-linux-overview/"
            title="Windows Subsystem for Linux Overview">no actual kernel</a>
    to reboot: it remains 4.4.0-42-Microsoft throughout. The kernel is
    emulated by Windows, not an actual file to boot, so upgrades only change
    the packages bundled with the kernel, not the kernel itself. <a
            href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/drawbridge/">The
        underlying abstraction</a> is quite elegant.</p>

<p>Can I drop Cygwin and make WSL my daily development environment? Not quite
    yet. For shell script work, WSL is excellent. But for my Kotlin, Java,
    Ruby, et al, other projects, I rely on IntelliJ IDEA as my editor (though
    Emacs might return into my life again). Filesystem interop between Windows
    programs (such as <code>java.exe</code>) and WSL is good <a

<dl>
    <dt>Cygwin on Windows</dt>
    <dd>This is and has been my solution for bash on Windows for many years. I
        will move to WSL when I'm ready, but I'm not ready yet. I need my
        regular development cycle to work first. (See <a href="#almost-there"><cite>Almost
            there</cite></a>.) There are downsides to Cygwin, for example,
        coping with line endings, but it's been reliable for me.
    </dd>
    <dt>Homebrew on Mac</dt>
    <dd>This is work. My company issues me a Mac laptop, and I use it. For the
        most part, it is fine for work with colleagues and clients, though at
        times the Mac is <a
                href="http://appletoolbox.com/2016/07/macos-sierra-features-review/">a
            little strange</a>, and much of the user experiences feels
        counterintuitive. Still, the software mostly works, and the hardware
        is incredibly good.
