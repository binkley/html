<h3>The landscape</h3>

<p>I'm helping someone with a scripting problem on an old system and an old
    shell. How old? Try IBM AIX 6.1, first released in 2007, and ksh93
    "e" released in ... 1993. At least the AIX is a version of 6.1 from 2014!
    (Kudos to IBM for treating long-term support seriously.)</p>

<p>A second point to ponder. The goal is to improve remote
    scripting&mdash;running scripts on a remote machine. In this
    environment, <code>ssh</code> exists but is not used. The remote execution
    tool chosen is <code>rexec</code>, <a
            href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_-1jwRwNaEoC&lpg=PA198&ots=KxAUu0sVYq&dq=rsh%20rexec%20dangerous&pg=PA198#v=onepage&q=rsh%20rexec%20dangerous&f=false">considered
        one of the most
        dangerous tools possible</a>. But my remit is not to address the
    insecurity, just to improve the scripting. (They know this is a bad,
    and are actively working to eventually resolve.)</p>

<p>So, given these constraints, what problem am I solving?</p>

<h3>Example problem</h3>

<p>This environment makes extensive use of remotely executed scripts to
    wire together a distributed, locally-hosted system. Current scripts
    duplicate the same approach, each implemented as a one-off: Copy a
    script to a remote machine with <code>rcp</code>; use
    <code>rexec</code> to invoke the script, capturing the output to a
    file on the remote host; copy the captured file back to the local host;
    process the output file; sometimes clean up the remote host afterwards.
</p>

<p>Some gotchas to watch out for with <code>ksh93e</code> or
    <code>rexec</code>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Function tracing - Using the standard <code>xtrace</code> setting
        to trace script execution in <code>ksh93</code> has <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2274727/250924">problems
            with tracing functions</a>, and requires using <em>old</em>-style
        function syntax
    </li>

    <li>Variable scope - To keep variables local to a function in
        <code>ksh93</code>, you must <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12004099/250924">use the
            <em>new</em>-style function syntax</a> (note the conflict with
        tracing)
    </li>

    <li>Exit broken with trap - When calling <code>exit</code> to quit a
        remote script, <code>trap</code> does not get a correct
        <code>$?</code> variable (it is always 0, as <code>exit</code>
        succeeded in returning a non-0 exit status). Instead one must "set"
        <code>$?</code> with the code of a failing command, and then leave
        with a plain call to <code>exit</code></li>

    <li>No pipefail - Release "e" of ksh93 just does not know anything
        about <code>set -o pipefail</code>, and there is no uninstrusive
        workaround. This now common feature showed up <a
                href="http://www.kornshell.com/doc/faq.html">in release
            "g"</a></li>

    <li>No exit code - Would you believe <code>rexec</code> does not
        itself <a
                href="https://www.unix.com/unix-for-dummies-questions-and-answers/20824-exit-codes-rexec.html">exit
            with the exit code of the remote command</a>, never has, and
        never will? It always exits 0 if the remote command could be started.
    </li>

    <li>Buffered <code>stderr</code> - Empirically, <code>rexec</code> (at
        least the version with this AIX) <em>buffers</em> the <code>stderr
        </code> stream of remote commands, and only flushes when <code>
            rexec</code> exits, so the sense of ordering between <code>
            stdout</code>, <code>stderr</code> and the command-line prompt is
        ever worse than usual (the actual handling <a
                href="http://www.manpagez.com/man/8/rexecd/">is
            unspecified</a>)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This problem and environment triggers a memory: The last time I worked
    on AIX was in 1994, and it was almost the same problem! I really
    thought I had escaped those days.</p>

<h3>A solution</h3>

<p>So I refactored. I couldn't change the use of <code>rexec</code>&mdash;this
    environment is not ready for SSH key management&mdash;, I couldn't
    replace KSH93 with BASH or replace AIX with Linux, but I could do
    something about the imperfect duplication and random detritus files.</p>

<h4>The solution</h4>

<p>Note the need to call a <code>fail</code> function instead of
    <code>exit</code> directly because of poor interaction with
    <code>trap</code>.</p>

<p>Assuming some help, such as a global <code>progname</code> variable
    (which could simply be <code>$0</code>), and avoiding remote
    temporary files:</p>
