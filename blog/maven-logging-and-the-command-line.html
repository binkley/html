<p>I usually set up my Maven-build projects to be as quiet as possible. My
    preference is "Silence is Golden": if the command says nothing on the
    command line, it worked; if it failed, it prints to STDERR.</p>

<p>However, sometimes I want to see some output while I'm tracking down a
    problem. How best to reconcile these?</p>

<p><a href="https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.3.1/release-notes.html"
      title="Release Notes â€“ Maven 3.3.1">Maven 3.3.1</a> (maybe earlier)
    introduced the <code>.mvn</code> directory for your project root (note
    leading DOT). In here you can keep a <code>jvm.config</code> file which
    has the flags to the <code>java</code> command used when running
    <code>mvn</code>. Here's my usual <code>jvm.config</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">
-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=WARN
-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.Sisu=WARN</pre>

<p>This quiets maven down quite a bit, using the properties to control Maven's
    more recent logger, SLF4J. And I normally commit that into my project code
    repository.</p>

<p>And for those times I'd like more output? I could edit the file, but I
    don't trust myself enough not to accidentally commit those temporary
    changes. So I use the command line:</p>

<pre class="code">$ MAVEN_OPTS='-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=INFO' mvn</pre>

<p>Ultimately <a
        href="https://github.com/apache/maven/blob/master/apache-maven/src/bin/mvn"><code>mvn</code>
    reads <code>.mvn/jvm.config</code></a>, putting the contents into the
    variable <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code>, and uses <code>MAVEN_OPTS</code> in the
    invocation of <code>java</code>, and you can override the variable
    yourself on the command line.</p>
