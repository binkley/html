        <h3>What are exceptions?</h3>

        <p>Essentially, exceptions are a form of structured, non-local
            <code>goto</code> with <a
                    href="http://wiki.c2.com/?UnwindingTheStack"
                    title="Unwinding The Stack">stack unwinding</a>.
            "Structured" here means <a
                    href="http://wiki.c2.com/?StructuredProgramming"
                    title="Structured Programming">"higher level than the
                machine"</a> (a matter of taste/opinion), and "non-local"
            means "beyond a single function/method".</p>

        <p>What this means is that you can replace code like (in "C"):</p>

        <pre class="code">int bottom()
{
    int things_go_wrong = -1; // For illustration

    if (things_go_wrong) goto error;
    return 0;

error:
    return -1;
}

int
middle()
{
    if (-1 == bottom()) goto error;
    return 0;

error:
    return -1;
}

void
top()
{
    if (-1 == middle()) {
        handle_failure();
    }
}</pre>
        <p>With code like (in Java):</p>

        <pre class="code">public class A {
    void botton() {
        boolean thingsGoWrong = true; // For illustration

        if (thingsGoWrong) throw new ThingsWentWrong("So wrong!");
    }

    void middle() {
        bottom();
    }

    void top() {
        try {
            middle();
        } catch (ThingsWentWrong e) {
            handleFailure();
        }
    }
}</pre>

        <p>(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16493261/250924"
                title="How to implement a try-catch block in scheme?">An
            example in Scheme</a>.)</p>

        <p>"Unwinding" here means the compiler or runtime treats
            intermediate calls (the stack) the same as if returning
            normally (for example, the stack pointer is moved back;
            and in a language like C++, destructors are executed), and
            program execution resumes in the <code>catch</code> block.</p>

        <p>It is "structured" in the sense that it is not the same as a
            direct <code>goto</code> to the resume point. This is not
            possible in standard "C" or C++ (or in Java), which only
            suppport local labels within functions. The equivalent in "C"
            and C++ is to use <a

                    title="setjmp.h"><code>setjmp</code> and
                <code>longjmp</code></a> for a non-local goto, and forget
            all about deallocating memory or calling destructors. (As odd as
            this sounds, it is needed for <a

                    title="A page about call/cc"><code>call-with-continuation</code></a>,
            an important feature in
            LISP-like languages).

        <h3>Takeaway</h3>

        <p>All human endeavors build on the work of those who came
            previous. <em>Exceptions</em> are no exception. They are the
            result of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling"
                    title="Exception handling">1960s and 1970s programmers</a>
            wanting an easier way to deal with
            <em>exceptional conditions</em>. This is not completely identical
            with "errors", which may sometimes be better represented with
            a simple boolean <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> return.
            Like any sharp instrument, <a
