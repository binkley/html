        <h3>What is this about?</h3>

        <p>This post is about application patterns for persistence and domain
            objects. I have never been fully satisfied with existing patterns
            in this area, so over the past six months I have run
            <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html"
               title="Create a Spike Solution">a series of spikes</a> to
            explore them, and find what did satisfy me. I <a

                    title="The Mail Must Get Through">scratched an itch</a>.
        </p>

        <p>My implementation focus is the JVM (Java, Kotlin, <i>et al</i>),
            though these patterns are not specific to the JVM, so perhaps
            they will be useful to you in other platforms and languages.

    <section id="the-problem">
        <h3>The problem</h3>

        <p>It is a rare business application, which does not involve
            persistence. With the advent of <a
                    href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"
                    title="Microservices">microservices</a>, this does not
            change: it shifts the persistence to another system component.
            So the question becomes: For the component managing the data,
            how best to model persistence in that program?
        </p>

        <p>Among existing patterns, I find these problems:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Complex and confusing organization of the source code,
                focused on technology or implementation rather than
                business domain
            </li>
            <li>Mingling of business and persistence concerns, often
                surfaced as mixing of data records with domain (business)
                logic
            </li>
            <li>Mingling of domains, often surfaced as data records and
                domain objects with inter-dependencies
            </li>
            <li>Excessive copying of data within the application,
                creating difficulties in data ownership, and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_%28computer_programming%29"
                        title="Action at a distance (computer programming)">
                    <i>action-at-a-distance</i></a> mutability
            </li>
            <li>Poor or uncertain performance of persistence queries
                (chiefly SQL, but this problem applies to other means of
                persisting)
            </li>
            <li>Difficult testing, with excessive mocking, and tedious or
                confusing test setup
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Two spikes</h3>

        <p>The two chief projects I have used for spiking are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/basilisk">
                <code>basilisk</code></a>, a Java implementation, the older
                of the two spikes
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/binkley/basilisk-kt">
                <code>basilisk-kt</code></a>, a Kotlin reimplementation,
                building on lessons learned
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>They both implement the business model</p>

        <h3>Patterns</h3>

        <p>The main pattern: <a
                href="https://martinfowler.com/tags/encapsulation.html">
            <em>Encapsulation</em></a>. The goal is that domain objects and
            their services should be as loosely-coupled as sensible. This
            improves the abilities to test and refactor. Accordingly, these
            patterns make certain assumptions:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A domain service is the factory for domain objects</li>
            <li>A domain service holds all references for other services,
                not the domain object
            </li>
            <li>A domain object should only have a direct reference to
                its persistence data, and its corresponding service
            </li>
            <li>Domain services and objects are concrete implementations;
                the application injects behavior variation into the service
            </li>
        </ul>
