        <h3>The setup</h3>

        <p>My team is working on a Java server, as part of a larger project
            project, using <a href="https://gradle.org/"
                    title="Gradle Build Tool">Gradle</a>, to build and <a
                    href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/"
                    title="JaCoCo Java Code Coverage Library">JaCoCo</a>
            to measure testing code coverage. The build fails if coverage
            drops below fixed limits (branch, instruction, and
            line)&mdash;"verification" in JaCoCo-speak.</p>

        <p>We follow the strategy of <a
                href="http://robertgreiner.com/2012/01/continuous-code-improvement-using-ratcheting/"
                title="Continuous Code Improvement Using Ratcheting"><em>The
            Ratchet</em></a>: as dev pairs push commits into the project, code
            coverage may not drop without group agreement, and if coverage
            rises, the verification limits rise to match. This ensures we
            have ever-rising coverage, and avoid new code which lacks
            adequate testing<a aria-describedby="footnote-label"

    <section id="the-problem">
        <h3>The problem</h3>

        <p>At a work project, we're struggling to get JaCoCo to ignore some
            new, configuration-only Java classes. These classes have no
            "real" implementation code to test, are used to setup
            communication with an external resource, yet are high
            line-count (static configuration via code). So they drag down
            our code coverage limits, and there is no effective way to
            unit test them sensibly. (They are best tested as system
            tests within our CI pipeline using live programs and remote
            resources.)</p>

        <p>JaCoCo has what seems at first blush a sensible way to exclude
            these configuration classes from testing:</p>

        <pre class="code">jacocoTestVerificationCoverage {
    violationRules {
        rule {
            excludes ['hm.binkley.labs.saml.SomeConfig']
            limit {
                counter = 'LINE'
                minimum = 0.90
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

        <p>Unfortunately, this does nothing. There is no warning or error,
            and coverage continues to include the whole code base.</p>

        <h3>A solution</h3>

        <p>After a lot of experimenting and StackOverflow research, <a
                href="http://jivimberg.io/blog/2018/04/26/gradle-verify-coverage-with-exclusions/"
                title="Jacoco &amp; Gradle - How to Verify Coverage With Exclusions">this
            answer from Juan Vimberg</a> worked exactly as we needed.
            Following his approach:</p>

        <pre class="code">final def excludedClasses = ['hm.binkley.labs.saml.SomeConfig']

jacocoTestVerificationCoverage {
    violationRules {
        rule {
            limit {
                counter = 'LINE'
                minimum = 0.90
            }
        }
    }

    afterEvaluate {
        classDirectories = files(classDirectories.files.collect {
            fileTree(dir: it, excludes: excludedClasses.collect {
                it.replace('.', '/') + '.class'
            })
        })
    }
}</pre>

        <p>The list of excluded classes is extracted so the same trick can
            be used in the generated reports:</p>

        <pre class="code">jacocoTestReport {
    executionData test, databaseTest
    reports {
        html.enabled = true
        xml.enabled = true
        csv.enabled = false
    }
    afterEvaluate {
        classDirectories = files(classDirectories.files.collect {
            fileTree(dir: it, excludes: excludedClasses.collect {
                it.replace('.', '/') + '.class'
            })
        })
    }
}</pre>

        <p>Something to consider: using wildcards
            (<code>hm.binkley.labs.saml.*</code>) may take additional work.
        </p>

    <section id="why">
        <h3>Why?</h3>

        <p>Why does this work, and the "obvious" way does not?</p>

        <p>JaCoCo has more than one notion of scoping. The clearest one is <a
                href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html">the
            <em>counters</em></a>: branches, classes, instructions, lines,
            and methods.</p>

        <p>Not as well documented is <a
                href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/check-mojo.html">the
            scope of checks</a>: bundles, classes, methods, packages, and
            source files. These are <em>not</em> mix-and-match. For
            example, exclusions apply to classes. Lyudmil Latinov has <a
                    href="https://automationrhapsody.com/automated-code-coverage-of-unit-tests-with-jacoco-and-maven/">the
                best hints I've found</a> on how this works.</p>
