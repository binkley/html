    <h3>Pipeline benefits</h3>

    <p>The pipeline is the principal tool in connecting work (developers,
        inputs) and value (production, outputs). Benefits include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It provides backpressure to developers, showing them problems
            earlier, and preventing many kinds of problems from appearing
            later in testing or production.
        </li>
        <li>It raises the efficiency and speed to production, automating many
            traditionally manual steps, especially around testing.
        </li>
        <li>It acts as a gate to production, increasing the options available
            to management. (But see <a href="#feature-toggles"><cite>Feature
                toggles</cite></a>, below, for a alternative and complimentary
            approach.)
        </li>
        <li>It includes quality control elements, increasing organizational
            confidence in the product and process. This includes historic data
            for trend analysis.
        </li>
        <li>It provides audit and control points for good governance, and an
            accurate, reproducible record.

<section id="pipeline-shape">
    <h3>Pipeline shape</h3>

    <p>Unlike a physical pipeline, a build pipeline is bi-directional.
        Developer work flows in towards production, and production
        environments flow towards development. Another way to express
        this:</p>

    <blockquote><em>Code should move as fast as possible towards production,
        and development should have the most production-like environment
        possible.</em></blockquote>

    <p>First, a pipeline. Note that work flows from development and into
        production. Similarly, the production environment is copied by earlier
        environments, usually becoming less faithful a reproduction each time
        like a picture photocopied repeatedly. And illustrated:</p>

        state as a horizontal line: work in production is identical to
        development&mdash;each commit by development flows directly into
        production&mdash;; the development environment is a fully faithful
        replica of the production environment.</p>

    <p>In the above illustration, pipeline and environments are tilted 7&deg;
        in opposite directions. As a consequence, the actual new work that is
        running in production is a smaller piece of the available work in
        development which could potentially be deployed. This represents
        <em>waste</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="more-on-the-bottom-illustration">More on the bottom
        illustration</h4>

    <p>The wedges in the upper half between the lighter and darker grey
        lines are work held back in an earlier environment from reaching a
        later environment.</p>

    <p>Similarly, wedges in the lower half represent later environmental
        concerns pushed into earlier environments, increasing the complexity
        of those lower environments.</p>

    <p>Lastly the blue line shows how work, thinning as it runs left to
        right, builds up in earlier environments, and either idles
        developers who wait on later environments to catch up, or product
        work that does not reach production. Similarly, higher
        environments, thinning as they run right to left, degrade in
        fidelity in lower environments.</p>

            in the age of the cloud, it is often feasible to exactly duplicate
            production, especially when system architecture assumes cloud and
            does not have built-in requirements of more than X servers or

            However, the non-production accounts should have the same access
            and setup as production, just against non-production resources.
