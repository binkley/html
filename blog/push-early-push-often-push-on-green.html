        <h3>Prologue</h3>

        <p>I'm chatting with a colleague who is <a
                href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/road-agile-practitioner-agile-coach"
                title="The Road from an Agile Practitioner to an Agile Coach">new
            in her role as an <em>Agile Coach</em></a> (she comes from a PM
            background). We were talking about ways to organize a team's story
            board (card wall), and turned to <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/defect-prevention-using-agile-techniques"
                    title="Defect Prevention Using Agile Techniques"><em>Desk
                Checks</em></a> and when they fit into a story's life.</p>

        <p>An interesting remark by her: a team had agreed to share work
            (push) only after the desk check was successful; that is, they did
            not push code until a story was almost done: work lay fallow on
            individuals' machines for potentially days at a stretch.</p>

        <p>I was surprised. Why would they wait days to push&mdash;what did
            they do about merge conflicts, complex refactorings, integration
            failures in the pipeline, <i>et al</i>?

        <p>To me this was clearly a <a

                Commits To the Mainline Every Day</cite></a>, and I would go
            further: <em>Push commits at <strong>the earliest responsible
                moment</strong></em>. This is opposite the advice for
            refactoring, or especially <a

        <p>And you can see why early pushes differ from the other two: waiting
            will not get your more information. On the contrary, waiting will
            only increase <a

        <p>(The "information" in the case of pushes are the pulled commits
            themselves.)</p>

        <p>I've definitely experienced this firsthand, when I'd eventually
            discard my local commits after waiting too long, and letting them
            grow too much in a different direction from how the rest of the
            team progressed. <a

        <h4>Complexity</h4>

        <p>Consider this work cycle:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Local commit</li>
            <li>Fetch commits from remote</li>
            <li>Merge, if needed</li>
            <li>Local commit again, if needed</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 1em">Push commits to remote</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I've grouped these to emphasize what is <em>local to you</em> (the
            first four) and what is <em>global to your team</em> (the last
            one).</p>

        <p>Considered only <em>locally</em>, you minimize entropy with <em>frequent
            pulls</em> for yourself, and likewise for your teammates
            individually, so you can catch merge conflicts early and resolve
            them when they are small. But considered <em>globally</em>, you
            need <em>frequent pushes</em> so those local pulls have only small
            changes in them. <em>The longer you wait to push, the more work
                for those who pull.</em></p>

        <table>
            <caption>Early push</caption>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>You</th>
                <th>Rest of team</th>
                <th>Work for others</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>You commit</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>You push</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>They pull</td>
                <td>Less complexity of merge (1 commit)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>You commit</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>You push</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>They pull</td>
                <td>Less complexity of merge (1 commit)</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Each single push can be treated on it's own. There are two
            opportunities for merge conflict, but each is a small amount of
            work.</p>

        <table>
            <caption>Late push<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></caption>
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>You</th>
                <th>Rest of team</th>

            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>You commit</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>They pull</td>
                <td>No changes to merge</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>You commit</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>You push</td>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>They pull</td>
                <td>Greater complexity of merge (2 commits)</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>In each scenario, there are two commits for others to content with.
            The larger, combined push has a greater opportunity for merge
            conflict, and a greater chance for a large amount of work, because
            of the combined interactions of the two commits.</p>

        <p>And as teams work in parallel, there are more opportunities for
            merge conflicts.</p>

        <h4>Push early, push often, push on green</h4>

        <p>From the above discussion, the safest course is to push early
            rather than wait as commits pile up locally. But when to push&mdash;what
            is the "earliest responsible moment"?</p>

        <p>If your codebase is well-tested, and answer presents itself: <em>Push
            when <strong>tests are green</strong> and <strong>changes alter
                the complexity</strong></em>.</p>

        <p>The goal is to avoid complex commit interactions that lead to merge
            conflicts. Tests are the safety net. Further, if all else fails
            and a commit is bad, it is easy to throw away the last commit
            until things are right again: only a small amount of work is lost,
            not days worth.</p>

        <p>Understanding what kind of changes alter complexity takes skill:
            skills improve with experience and coaching. The cost of early
            pushes is low, and the occassional penalty of late pushes high, so
            this would be a good topic for a "team norms" ("dev practices")
            discussion.</p>

        <p>For example, the team might agree that changes to comments are not
            in themselves worth a push. At the other end, your refactorings
            which impact more than one source file almost certainly should be
            pushed early: discover their impact on others before you add more
            refactorings.</p>

        <p>A good work cycle:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Pull</li>
            <li>Build, run tests</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 1em">Edit sources</li>
            <li>Build, run tests</li>
            <li>Commit</li>
            <li>Pull and push</li>
        </ol>

        <p>After a preliminary sanity check (#1 and #2), get in the the cycle
            of #3 to #6.</p>

    <section id="epilogue">
        <h3>Epilogue</h3>

        <p>I checked other teams: it is minority practice to wait until a
            successful desk check to push changes. That's a relief. Hopefully
            this practice can be made more rare.</p>

        <p>One rational reason&mdash;itself a smell&mdash;is when tests take
            too long to run frequently. When I design a pipeline, I recommend
            breaking out "unit" tests from "integration" tests for this exact
            reason: even when integration tests run long, the initial CI stage
            with just unit tests should be fast enough to give quick feedback
            on frequent pushes, and encourage <em>Push early, Push often, Push
                on (local) green</em>.</p>

        <p id="fn1"><sup>[1]</sup> The simple statement, "a greater chance for
            a large amount of work", has rather complex reasoning behind it,
            beyond the scope of this post.</p>
        <p>For example, any particular commit
            can be viewed as applying an exponent to the overall complexity of
            a program. A neutral change (say, correcting a typo in a comment)
            has the exponent <em>1</em>: it does not change the overall
            complexity; a positive change (say, removing code duplication) has
            an exponent between <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>: it lowers the
            overall complexity; a negative change (say, adding a new
            dependency) has an exponent greater than <em>1</em>: it raises the
            overall complexity.</p>
        <p>Consider then that these complexity changes are not simple numbers,
            but distributions ("odds"), and change with time ("bitrot"), and
            involve more than the code (people or requirments changes).</p>

        <p id="fn2"><sup>[2]</sup> In Seth's post, do not confuse "publish
            once" with "wait to push": it means "don't publish the same commit
            twice" (which does sometimes happen accidentally, even for
            experts, from merging or rebasing).</p>
