        <p>I'm chatting with a colleague who is new in her role as an
            <em>Agile Coach</em>; she comes from a PM background. We were
            talking about ways to organize a team's story board (card wall),
            and turned to
            <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/defect-prevention-using-agile-techniques"
                    title="Defect Prevention Using Agile Techniques"><em>Desk
                Checks</em></a>, and when they happen in a story's
            lifecycle.</p>

        <p>An interesting remark by her: an earlier team she had been on
            agreed to share work (push) only if the desk check were
            successful! That is, they do not push code until a story is
            almost done, and lots of work lies fallow on individuals'
            machines in the meanwhile.</p>

        <p>I was floored. The team she had been on was a strong agile
            team, with experienced members. Why would they wait to push
            until days of work had passed? What did they do about merge
            conflicts, complex refactorings, integration failures in the
            pipeline, <i>et al</i>?</p>

        <p>So my colleague and I had a great session together, me
            explaining the world from a dev perspective.</p>
