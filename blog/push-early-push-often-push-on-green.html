        <h3>Prologue</h3>

        <p>I'm chatting with a colleague who is <a
                href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/road-agile-practitioner-agile-coach"
                title="The Road from an Agile Practitioner to an Agile Coach">new
            in her role as an <em>Agile Coach</em></a>; she comes from a PM
            background. We were talking about ways to organize a team's story
            board (card wall), and turned to <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/defect-prevention-using-agile-techniques"
                    title="Defect Prevention Using Agile Techniques"><em>Desk
                Checks</em></a> and when they fit into a story's life.</p>

        <p>An interesting remark by her: a team she had once been on had
            agreed to share work (push) only after the desk check was
            successful. That is, they did not push code until a story was
            almost done: work lay fallow on individuals' machines pending desk
            check.</p>

        <p>I was floored. The team she had been on was a strong agile team
            with experienced members. Why would they wait to push until days
            of work had passed? What did they do about merge conflicts,
            complex refactorings, integration failures in the pipeline, <i>et
                al</i>?</p>
