        <h3>Prologue</h3>

        <p>I'm chatting with a colleague who is <a
                href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/road-agile-practitioner-agile-coach"
                title="The Road from an Agile Practitioner to an Agile Coach">new
            in her role as an <em>Agile Coach</em></a> (she comes from a PM
            background). We were talking about ways to organize a team's story
            board (card wall), and turned to <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/defect-prevention-using-agile-techniques"
                    title="Defect Prevention Using Agile Techniques"><em>Desk
                Checks</em></a> and when they fit into a story's life.</p>

        <p>An interesting remark by her: a previous team of hers had agreed to
            share work (push) only after the desk check was successful; that
            is, they did not push code until a story was almost done: work lay
            fallow on individuals' machines for potentially days at a
            stretch.</p>

        <p>I was surprised. Hers was a strong agile team with experienced
            members. Why would they wait days to push&mdash;what did they do
            about merge conflicts, complex refactorings, integration failures
            in the pipeline, <i>et al</i>?

        <h3>Lecture</h3>

        <p>To me this was clearly a <a
                href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html"
                title="Code Smell"><em>smell</em></a>. Martin Fowler
            specifically addresses this in <a
                    href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html#EveryoneCommitsToTheMainlineEveryDay"
                    title="Everyone Commits To the Mainline Every Day"><cite>Everyone
                Commits To the Mainline Every Day</cite></a>, and I would go
            further: <em>Push commits at <strong>the earliest responsible
                moment</strong></em>. This is opposite the advice for
            refactoring, or especially <a
                    href="https://www.slideshare.net/ThoughtWorks/neal-ford-emergent-design-and-evolutionary-architecture"
                    title="emergent design &amp; evolutionary architecture"><em>emergent
                design</em></a>, where the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)">"Rule
                of 3"</a> and <a
                    href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-last-responsible-moment/"
                    title="The Last Responsible Moment"><cite>last responsible
                moment</cite></a> cautions waiting for more information before
            committing to a course of action.</p>

        <p>And you can see why early pushes differ from the other two: waiting
            will not get your more information. On the contrary, waiting will
            only increase <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy"
                    title="Software entropy">the entropy of the code base</a>!
        </p>

        <p>Consider this work cycle:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Local commit</li>
            <li>Fetch commits from remote</li>
            <li>Merge, if needed</li>
            <li>Local commit again, if needed</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 1em">Push commits to remote</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I've grouped these to emphasize what is <em>local to you</em> (the
            first four) and what is <em>global to your team</em> (the last
            one).</p>

        <p>Considered only <em>locally</em>, you and your team minimized
            entropy with <em>frequent pulls</em>, so you can catch merge
            conflicts early and resolve them when they are small. But
            considered <em>globally</em>, this implies you have <em>frequent
                pushes</em> so that those local pulls have only small changes
            in them.</p>
