<p>We wanted to use JDBC with Java Streams, but encountered several
    difficulties. Fortunately we found solutions with rather small bits of
    code.</p>

<p><strong>TODO: SOME BACKGROUND ON JDBC (since 1.1) AND STREAMS (since 1.8),
    MAYBE LINK TO OPINION POST ON LACK OF SUPPORT</strong></p>

<h3>Checked exceptions</h3>

<p>The main obstacle was the JDBC API throwing <code>SQLException</code> for
    all API methods used in our code. <code>SQLException</code> is a <em>checked
        exception</em>, so must be declared in our method signatures, or
    caught otherwise. However the Streams API only accepts methods which
    declare to throw <em>no</em> checked exceptions, so something simple like
    this will not compile:</p>

<pre class="code">stream(results).
        map(row -&gt; row.getString("label")).  // checked exception
        forEach(this::processLabel);</pre>

<p>The call to <code>ResultSet.getString(String)</code> throws a checked
    exception. The usual approach is to wrap the call, and handle the
    exception in the wrapping method:</p>

<pre class="code">method String streamGetLabel(final ResultSet results) {
    try {
        return results.getString("label");
    } catch (final SQLException e) {
        throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
    }
}</pre>

<p>(Here <code>UncheckedIOException</code> is an unchecked exception wrapper
    we wrote for <code>SQLException</code>, similar to <code>UncheckedIOException</code>
    in the JDK for <code>IOException</code>.) </p>

<p>Then the stream becomes:</p>

<pre class="code">stream(results).
        map(this::streamGetLabel).
        forEach(this::processLabel);</pre>

<p>This is OK, however needing to write a wrapper method for each time we
    wanted to use JDBC in a stream became tedious.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>First we wrote a SAM (<strong>TODO: REFERENCE</strong>) interface as a
    lookalike for the JDK <code>Function</code> interface: this is what <code>Stream.map(Function)</code>
    wants.</code>  The lookalike is different in that it throws <code>SQLException</code>:
</p>

<pre class="code">@FunctionalInterface
public interface SQLFunction&lt;T, R&gt; {
    R apply(final T t) throws SQLException;

    // Other default methods
}</pre>

<p>Then we used this in a closed <code>Function</code> implementation to wrap
    and delegate to the lookalike, and throw
    <code>UncheckedSQLException</code> if the lookalike throws <code>
        SQLException</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">@RequiredArgsConstructor(staticName = "applyUnchecked")
public final class UncheckedSQLFunction&lt;T, R&gt;
        implements Function&lt;T, R&gt; {
    private final SQLFunction&lt;T, R&gt; wrapped;

    @Override
    public R apply(final T t) {
        try {
            return wrapped.apply(t);
        } catch (final SQLException e) {
            throw new UncheckedSQLException(e);
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>(Here we use the excellent Lombok (<strong>TODO: REFERENCE</strong> to
    generate our constructor, and give us a static convenience method,
    "applyUnchecked".)</p>

<p>Finally some static import, and our example streams use becomes:</p>

<pre class="code">stream(results).
        map(applyUnchecked(row -> row.getString("label"))).
        forEach(this::processLabel);</pre>

<p>We wrote similar lookalikes and wrappers for <code>Predicate</code> and
    <code>Consumer</code>. It would be easy enough to write them for other
    Java functional interfaces, such as <code>BiFunction</code>.</p>

<h3>Streaming result sets</h3>

<p>The next difficulty we tackled was how to loop over <code>ResultSet </code>,
    and use them with Streams.</p>

<p>(A side note: <code>ResultSet</code> is not a <em>set</em> but a
    <em>list</em>: rows are ordered, and they can duplicate each other in
    their column data. However, I believe they were named after the SQL
    concept of sets, not the Java one.)</p>

<h3>Transactions</h3>

<h3>Exception handling</h3>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There is nothing we did that was difficult or complex: simple one-liner
    interfaces, simple wrapper implementations of Java funcional interfaces,
    some rote following of JDBC best practice. The main difficulty was
    conceptual: seeing the duplication of many, small wrapper methods, and
    pulling out their commonality.</p>
