<p>IntelliJ sports an excellent terminal emulator (the "Terminal" tab at
    bottom of the editor). By default it brings up a terminal native to your
    Operating System: <code>CMD.EXE</code> on Windows, <code>$SHELL</code> on
    Linux and Mac.</p>

<p>However I prefer Cygwin when I work on Windows. WSL is incredible, but
    there are still interoperability issues between its filesystem and
    Windows-native programs, and IntelliJ (which relies on
    <code>java.exe</code>, a Windows-native program) <a
            href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-171457"
            title="Support for WSL project ">is still working on it</a>.</p>

<p>So, how to open a Cygwin terminal in IntelliJ? Setting the program to start
    in <code>Settings|Tools|Terminal|Shell path</code>, the most obvious thing
    to do, does not quite work:</p>

<pre class="code">C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe</pre>

<p>This is a non-interactive shell, and does not source your profile. The next
    try is:</p>

<pre class="code">C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe --login -i</pre>

<p>This produces an error from IntelliJ that it cannot the program correctly.
    A little checking says the leading command needs to be quoted, else
    IntelliJ treats the entire line as the name of the command, not as a
    command followed by flags. OK:</p>

<pre class="code">"C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.exe" --login -i</pre>

<p>Hey, I have a shell! Unfortunately, it starts in my home directory, not in
    my project root. Starting in the project root is one of the nicer features
    of the terminal in IntelliJ. Finally, two changes. First the IntelliJ
    setting:</p>

<pre class="code">"C:\cygwin64\bin\bash" -c "exec /usr/bin/env INTELLIJ=true $SHELL --login -i"</pre>

<p>And an addition to my <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">${INTELLIJ-false} && cd ${OLDPWD-.}</pre>

<p>Ipso presto!</p>
