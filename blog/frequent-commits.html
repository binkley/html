<h3>A source control pattern for TDD</h3>
<p>At work we recently revisited our commit practices. One issue spotted:
    we didn't commit often enough. To address we adopted the source control
    pattern in this post. There are lots of benefits; the one that mattered
    to me most: <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater">No
        more throwing the baby out with the bathwater</a>, that is, no more
    two hour coding sessions only to start again and lose the good with the
    bad.</p>
<p>So we worked out this command-line pattern using single unit-of-work
    commits (without <code>git rebase -i</code>!):</p>
<pre class="code"># TDD cycle: edit code, run tests, rather-rinse-repeat until green
$ git pull --rebase &amp;&amp; <i>run tests</i> &amp;&amp; git commit -a --amend --no-edit</pre>
<pre class="code"># Simple unit-of-work commit, push, begin TDD cycle again
$ git commit --amend &amp;&amp; git push &amp;&amp; git commit --allow-empty -m <i>WIP</i></pre>
<p>What is this?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Start with a pull. This ensures you are always current, and find
        conflicts as soon as possible.
    </li>
    <li>Run your <em>full tests</em>. This depends on your project, for
        example, <code>mvn verify</code> or <code>rake</code>. If some tests
        are slow, split them out, and add a full test run before pushing.
    </li>
    <li>Amend your work to the current commit. This gives you a safe fallback
        known to pass tests. Worst case you might lose some recent work, but
        not hours worth. (Hint: <strong>run tests often</strong>.)
    </li>
    <li>When ready to push, update the commit message to the final message for
        public push.
    </li>
    <li>Push. Share. Make the world better.</li>
    <li>Restart the TDD cycle with an empty commit using a message that makes
        sense to you, for example "WIP" (work in progress); the message should
        be obvious not to push. Key: the TDD cycle command line only amends
        commits, so you need a first, empty commit to amend against.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>Bootstrapping</h4>
<p>The TDD cycle depends on an initial, empty commit. The first time using
    this source control pattern:</p>
<pre class="code"># Do this after the most recent commit, before any edits
$ git commit --allow-empty -m <i>WIP</i></pre>
<h4>Adding files</h4>
<p>This pattern, though very useful, does not address new files. You do
    need to run <code>git add</code> with new files to include them in the
    commit. Automatically adding new files can be dangerous if
    <code>gitignore</code> isn't set up right.</p>
<h4>It depends on your style</h4>
<p>The exact command line depends on your style. You could include a script
    to run before tests, or before commit (though the latter might be
    better done with a git pre-commit hook). You might prefer merge pulls
    instead of rebase pulls. If your editor runs from the command line you
    might toss <code>$EDITOR</code> at the front of the TDD cycle.</p>
<p>The command lines assume git, but this source control pattern works with
    any system that supports similar functionality.</p>
<h4>Fine-grained commits</h4>
<p>An example of style choice. If you prefer fine-grained commits to
    unit-of-work single commits (depending on your taste or project; they're
    both good practice):</p>
<pre class="code"># TDD cycle: edit code, run tests, rather-rinse-repeat until green
$ git pull --rebase &amp;&amp; <i>run tests</i> &amp;&amp; git commit -a</pre>
<pre class="code"># Fine-grained commits, push, begin TDD cycle again
$ git push</pre>
<h4>Improving your life</h4>
<p>No matter your exact command line, it can be made friendlier for you.
    Yes, shell history can story your long chain of commands. What if they
    vary slightly between programmers sharing a project, or what if there
    is a common standard approach? <a

            title="Write Your Own Git Subcommands">Extend git</a>. Let's call
    our example subcommand "tdd". Save this in a file named
    <code>git-tdd</code> in your <code>$PATH</code>:</p>
<pre class="code">#!/bin/sh
set -e
case $1 in
    test ) git pull --rebase &amp;&amp; <i>run tests</i> &amp;&amp; git commit -a --amend --no-edit ;;
    accept ) git commit --amend &amp;&amp; git push &amp;&amp; git commit --allow-empty -m <i>WIP</i> ;;
esac</pre>
<p>Now your command line becomes:</p>
<pre class="code">$ git tdd test  # Repeat until unit of work is ready
$ git tdd accept</pre>
