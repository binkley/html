        <h2>I have a dream (Story Card)</h2>
        <p>What is my dream story card? I don't mean: <em>What's the story
            I'd most like to work on</em>! I mean: <em>What should a
            virtual story card look like</em> (as opposed to card stock on
            a wall)? This may be a trivial question. But for me the
            <strong>user experience</strong> working with stories is very
            important: I work with them daily, write them, discuss them,
            work on them, accept them, etc. I want the feel of the card to be
            <em>thoughtful</em>, like that fellow to the right.</p>
        <p>And more than that. I am lazy, impatient, hubristic. The
            <strong>acceptance criteria</strong>, I want them testable,
            literally testable in that each has a matching test I can
            execute. Given my laziness, I don't want to switch systems
            and run tests; I'd like to execute acceptance criteria directly
            from the story card.</p>
        <p>So is there a system like that today? No. There are bits and
            pieces though.</p>

        <p>Some story card systems are particularly awkward to read,

            <li>A hard-coded workflow that the team cannot be change to fit

                nice is unconfigurable labels, especially when the button
                labels are misleading
            </li>
            <li>A hard-coded or limited hierarchy of stories, so if a
                team uses <em>epics</em> or <em>features</em> or
                <em>themes</em> or whatever to organize stories, and there
                are more than one level to this, the team is out of luck
            </li>
            <li>Lack of quality RESTful support, in particular, no simple
                identifier for story cards, so linking directly to cards is
                opaque, useless or completely absent

    <section id="scenario">
        <h2>A scenario</h2>
        <p>Post-development testing on this team is a fairly ordinary role.
            The developers say: a new web page is ready. Testers then
            validate the same page features each time for each new page,
            simple things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can an account with security role <samp>X</samp> log in?</li>
            <li>Can <samp>X</samp> submit the form? (Or not submit if
                forbidden?)
            </li>
            <li>What form defaults appear for role <samp>X</samp>? Do they
                reflect role <samp>X</samp>?
            </li>

        <p>(Yes, I know &mdash; what about developer testing? Bear with

        <p>On it goes, the same work each time. Redundant, repetitive,
            error-prone, fiddly. And worst of all&mdash;<em>boring</em>,
            <strong>BORING</strong>! This is traditional, manual "user
            testing" at its worst.</p>

        <p>After all, the testing is valuable: nobody wants broken web pages;
            everybody wants to log in. But the tester is valuable, too,
            more valuable even: is this the <em>most</em> valuable testing
            a human could do? Surely people are more clever, more
            insightful than this. And what about all the other page
            features not tested because of time spent on the basics?</p>
        <p>Well, people are more clever than this.</p>

        <h2>Clearing the path</h2>
        <p>What guides testing? If you're using nearly any form of modern user
            story writing, this includes something like "Acceptance Criteria".
            These are the gates that permit story development to be called
            successful: the testers are gatekeepers <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/how-we-eliminated-gatekeeper-quality">in
                the manual testing world</a>. In the manual world these
            criteria might be congregated into a single "Requirements
            Document" or similar (think: <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front">big,
                upfront design</a>).</p>
        <p>We can do better! Gatekeeper-style testing assumes a linear path
            from requirements to implementation to testing, just as waterfall
            considers these activities as distinct phases. But we know
            agile approaches do better than waterfall in most cases. Why
            should we build our teams to mirror waterfall? Of course the
            answer is to structure teams to look agile, just as the team
            itself practices agile values.</p>
        <p>So how do we make <em>Acceptance Criteria</em> more agile?</p>

        <p>A key component of playable cards are the
            <em>Acceptance Criteria</em> &mdash; answering the question,
            "What does success look like?" when a story is finished.</p>
        <p>The perspectives include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BA</strong>: Is the story told right? &mdash; What
                is the way to describe the work?
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dev</strong>: Is the story the right size? &mdash;
                What is the complexity of the work?
            </li>
            <li><strong>QA</strong>: Is it the right story to tell? &mdash;
                What is the value of the work?

    <section id="acceptance-criteria">
        <h2>What are Acceptance Criteria?</h2>
        <p>But where does this simple testing come from? Any software delivery
            process beyond "winging it" has some requirements</p>
        <p>Well-written agile stories have Acceptance Criteria. What are
            these? An Acceptance Criteria (AC) is a statement in a story that
            a tester (QA) can use to validate that all or a portion of the
            story is complete. The formulaic phrasing for ACs I like best
            is:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <span class="story-syntax">GIVEN</span> <em>some state of the
            world</em><br>
            <span class="story-syntax">WHEN</span> <em>some change
            happens</em><br>
            <span class="story-syntax">THEN</span> <em>some observable
            outcome results</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Generally for web applications this means when I do something with
            a web page in the application, then the page changes in some
            particular way or submits a request and the response page has
            some particular quality or property (or the negative case that
            is does not have that quality or property).</p>
        <p>In some cases it is even simpler: just check that a particular web
            address fully loads, for example, when testing login access to
            pages.</p>

        <h2>So what's the question?</h2>
        <p>Wherever possible we want to automate. If something can be done for
            us by a computing machine, we don't want to spend human time on
            it. Humans can move on to more interesting, valuable work when
            existing tasks can be automated.</p>
        <p>Consider the Test Pyramid (<em>image right</em>): automating
            lower-value tests focuses people on higher-value ones. You get
            more human attention and insight on the kinds of tests which best
            improve the value of software. You win more.</p>

        <p>This is a sample story card with a simplistic implementation of

        <h2>Acceptance Criteria states</h2>
        <p>Every AC potentially has a message from the testing system
            giving more detail on state. These are noted below.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Missing</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>This AC has no matching test in the testing system. Use
                    the <em>Create</em> button to create a new test. This does
                    not run the test.</p>
                <p>The <em>message</em> is boilerplate to remind users to
                    create tests.</p>
            </dd>

                <p>The AC has a matching test in the testing system, but the
                    test has never been run. Use the <em>Test</em> button to
                    run the test.</p>
                <p>Typically there is no <em>message</em> for this state.</p>

                <p>The <em>message</em>, is supported by the testing
                    system, should give a notion of progress. See <a

        <h2>Potential problems</h2>
        <p>Nothing is free. Potential problems with AACs include:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Integrations</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>There are no existing
                    integrations along these lines. You need to build your
                    own against JIRA, Mingle, FitNesse, Cucumber, etc. Whether
                    the story system drives the interaction, or the test
                    system does, may depend on the exact combination. Best
                    would be if both systems can call the other.</p></dd>
            <dt>Scaling</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>As more AACs run, the complete suite takes longer. For
                    example, adding 1 minute of AAC/story, and 5
                    stories/iteration, in a 12 iteration project takes 60
                    minutes to run. This is not specific to AACs but a
                    general problem with acceptance tests. It's still much
                    cheaper than the manual steps for each test, but
                    prohibitive for a developer to run the whole suite
                    locally.</p>
                <p><em>Best practice</em> is for the 3 amigos to run only
                    the tests specific to a story before calling that story
                    <em>Ready to Accept</em>.</p></dd>

        <h2>Update</h2>
        <p>Until I published this post on Blogger, I really wasn't certain how
            it would look on that platform. I manually tested the visuals from
            Chrome with <a
                    href="https://github.com/binkley/html/blob/master/blog/automated-acceptance-criteria.html">the
                local post</a>, and it looked good. After seeing it in
            Blogger, however, the "aside" sections are laid out poorly,
            overlapping the text. I won't relay the page: mistakes are the
            best way to improve, and a subtext of this post is <a
                    href="http://modernagile.org/#guildingPrinciples">Experiment
                &amp; Learn Rapidly</a>. Public experiements are the most
            faithful kind: no opportunity to fudge and pretend all was well on
            the first try.</p>
