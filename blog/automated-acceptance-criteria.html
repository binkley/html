<h1>Automated Acceptance Criteria</h1>
<h2>What are Acceptance Criteria?</h2>
<p>Well-written agile stories have Acceptance Criteria. What are
    these? An Acceptance Criteria (AC) is a statement in a story that a
    tester (QA) can use to validate that all or a portion of the story is
    complete. The formulaic phrasing for ACs I like best is:</p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>GIVEN</strong> <em>some state of the world</em><br>
    <strong>WHEN</strong> <em>some change happens</em><br>
    <strong>THEN</strong> <em>some observable outcome results</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally for web applications this means when I do something with a
    web page in the application, then the page changes in some particular
    way or submits a request and the response page has some particular quality
    or property (or the negative case that is does not have that quality or
    property).</p>
<p>In some cases it is even simpler: just check that a particular web address
    fully loads, for example, when testing login access to pages.</p>
<h2>So what's the question?</h2>
<p>Wherever possible we want to automate.  If something can be done for
    us by a computing machine, we don't want to spend human time on it.
    Humans can move on to more interesting, valuable work when existing
    tasks can be automated.</p>
