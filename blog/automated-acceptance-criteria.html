        <p>Post-development testing on this team is a fairly ordinary role.
            The developers say a new web page is ready. Testers then
            validate the same page features each time for each new page,
            simple things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can an account with security role <samp>X</samp> log in?</li>
            <li>Can <samp>X</samp> submit the form? (Or not submit if
                forbidden?)
            </li>
            <li>What page form defaults appear for role <samp>X</samp>? Do
                they reflect role <samp>X</samp>?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>(Yes, I know &mdash; what about developer testing? Bear with
            me.)</p>

        <p>On it goes, the same work each time. Redundant, repetitive,
            error-prone, fiddly. And worst of all&mdash;<em>boring</em>,
            <strong>BORING</strong>! This is traditional, manual "user
            testing" at its worst.</p>
        <p><em>What's to be done?</em> <em>Can we fix this?</em></p>
        <p>After all, the testing is valuable: nobody wants broken web pages;
            everybody wants to log in. But is this the <em>most</em> valuable
            testing a human could do? Surely people are more clever, more
            insightful than this. And what about all the other page
            features not tested because of time spent on the basics?</p>
        <p>Well, people are more clever than this.</p>

        <h2>A forward path</h2>
        <p class="todo">Better section title</p>
        <p>What guides testing? If you're using nearly any form of modern user
            story writing, this includes something like "Acceptance Criteria".
            These are the gates that permit story development to be called
            successful: the testers are gatekeepers <a
                    href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/how-we-eliminated-gatekeeper-quality">in
                the manual testing world</a>. In the manual world these
            criteria might be congregated into a single "Requirements
            Document" or similar (think: <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front">big,
                upfront design</a>).</p>
        <p>We can do better! Gatekeeper-style testing assumes a linear path
            from requirements to implementation to testing, just as waterfall
            considers these activities as distinct phases. But we know
            agile approaches do better than waterfall in most (nearly all)
            cases. Why should we build our teams to mirror waterfall? Of
            course the answer is to structure teams to look agile, even as
            the team itself practices agile values.</p>

        <h2>What are Acceptance Criteria?</h2>
        <p>But where does this simple testing come from? Any software delivery
            process beyond "winging it" has some requirements</p>
        <p>Well-written agile stories have Acceptance Criteria. What are
            these? An Acceptance Criteria (AC) is a statement in a story that
            a tester (QA) can use to validate that all or a portion of the
            story is complete. The formulaic phrasing for ACs I like best
            is:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>GIVEN</strong> <em>some state of the world</em><br>
            <strong>WHEN</strong> <em>some change happens</em><br>
            <strong>THEN</strong> <em>some observable outcome results</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Generally for web applications this means when I do something with
            a web page in the application, then the page changes in some
            particular way or submits a request and the response page has
            some particular quality or property (or the negative case that
            is does not have that quality or property).</p>
        <p>In some cases it is even simpler: just check that a particular web
            address fully loads, for example, when testing login access to
            pages.</p>

        <h2>So what's the question?</h2>
        <p>Wherever possible we want to automate. If something can be done for
            us by a computing machine, we don't want to spend human time on
            it. Humans can move on to more interesting, valuable work when
            existing tasks can be automated.</p>
        <p>Consider the Test Pyramid (<em>image right</em>): automating
            lower-value tests focuses people on higher-value ones. You get
            more human attention and insight on the kinds of tests which best
            improve the value of software. You win more.</p>
