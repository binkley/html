<h1>Automated Acceptance Criteria</h1>
<h2>A scenario</h2>
<p>Post-development testing on my team is a fairly ordinary role. The
    developers says a new web page is ready. Folks in the testing role then
    test the same page features each time, simple things like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Can an account with security role <samp>X</samp> log in?</li>
    <li>Can <samp>X</samp> submit the form? (Or not submit if forbidden?)</li>
    <li>What page form defaults appear for role <samp>X</samp>? Do they
        reflect role <samp>X</samp>?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>(Yes, I know &mdash; what about developer testing? Different article.)</p>

<p>On it goes, the same work each time. Redundant, repetitive, error-prone,
    fiddly. And worst of all&mdash;<em>boring</em>! And yet, all manual.</p>
<p><em>How do we fix this?</em> <em>Can we fix this?</em></p>
<p>After all, the testing is valuable: nobody wants broken web pages;
    everybody wants to log in. But is it the <em>most</em> valuable testing
    a human could do? Surely people are more clever, more insightful than
    this.</p>
<h2>A forward path</h2>
<p>What are the testers testing? If you're using nearly any form of
    modern user story writing, this includes something like "Acceptance
    Criteria". These are the gates that permit story development to be
    called successful: the testers are gatekeepers.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What are Acceptance Criteria?</h2>
<p>But where does this simple testing come from? Any software delivery
    process beyond "winging it" has some requirements</p>
<p>Well-written agile stories have Acceptance Criteria. What are
    these? An Acceptance Criteria (AC) is a statement in a story that a
    tester (QA) can use to validate that all or a portion of the story is
    complete. The formulaic phrasing for ACs I like best is:</p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>GIVEN</strong> <em>some state of the world</em><br>
    <strong>WHEN</strong> <em>some change happens</em><br>
    <strong>THEN</strong> <em>some observable outcome results</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally for web applications this means when I do something with a
    web page in the application, then the page changes in some particular
    way or submits a request and the response page has some particular quality
    or property (or the negative case that is does not have that quality or
    property).</p>
<p>In some cases it is even simpler: just check that a particular web address
    fully loads, for example, when testing login access to pages.</p>

<h2>So what's the question?</h2>
<p>Wherever possible we want to automate. If something can be done for
    us by a computing machine, we don't want to spend human time on it.
    Humans can move on to more interesting, valuable work when existing
    tasks can be automated.</p>
<p>Consider the Test Pyramid (<em>image right</em>): automating lower-value
    tests focuses people on higher-value ones. You get more human attention
    and insight on the kinds of tests which best improve the value of
    software. You win more.</p>
<p>So if testers are spending time checking page access, or login</p>
